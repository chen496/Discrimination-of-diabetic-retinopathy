# Discrimination of diabetic retinopathy from optical coherence tomography angiography images using machine learning methods



Overview:
----------
The goal of this project was to discriminate between diabetic retinopathy (DR) and healthy controls (HC) by evaluating Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images from 3Ã—3 mm scans in the assistance with different machine learning models.


Sensitivity and Specificity:
